# MemoryTools Node.js Client

A Node.js client for interacting with the MemoryTools database via its TLS-based binary protocol.

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

To integrate `memory-tools-client` into your Node.js project, use npm:

```bash
npm install memory-tools-client
```

## ðŸ“– Usage

### Initialization, Connection, and Authentication

The `MemoryToolsClient` class allows you to connect to your MemoryTools server and **authenticate**. Providing user credentials is highly recommended for most operations.

```javascript
import { MemoryToolsClient } from "memory-tools-client";
import path from "node:path"; // For handling certificate paths

// Your MemoryTools server configuration
const DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
const DB_PORT = 3443;
const DB_USER = "myuser"; // Your username!
const DB_PASS = "mypassword"; // Your password!

// TLS Connection Options:

// Option 1: Secure connection with server certificate verification (RECOMMENDED for production)
// You need the .crt file from your server.
const SERVER_CERT_PATH_SECURE = path.join(
  process.cwd(),
  "certificates",
  "server.crt"
);
const clientSecure = new MemoryToolsClient(
  DB_HOST,
  DB_PORT,
  DB_USER,
  DB_PASS,
  SERVER_CERT_PATH_SECURE, // Path to the CA certificate that signed your server's certificate
  true // rejectUnauthorized: true (default)
);

// Option 2: Encrypted connection using system's default CAs (Secure if CA is trusted by OS)
// Node.js will use the operating system's default CAs. If your server uses a self-signed
// certificate not trusted by the OS, the connection will fail unless the CA is in the system store.
const clientSystemCA = new MemoryToolsClient(
  DB_HOST,
  DB_PORT,
  DB_USER,
  DB_PASS,
  null, // serverCertPath: null (uses system CAs)
  true // rejectUnauthorized: true (default)
);

// Option 3: Encrypted connection without any server certificate verification (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)
// Useful for local development with self-signed certificates if you don't want
// to manage a certificate file on your client.
const clientInsecure = new MemoryToolsClient(
  DB_HOST,
  DB_PORT,
  DB_USER,
  DB_PASS,
  null, // serverCertPath: null
  false // rejectUnauthorized: false (ignores verification)
);

async function runExample() {
  const client = clientSecure; // Choose the client instance you want to use for the example

  try {
    await client.connect();
    console.log(
      `Connected and authenticated as ${client.getAuthenticatedUsername()} to the MemoryTools database.`
    );

    // Perform your database operations here
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Connection or operation error:", error.message);
  } finally {
    // Ensure the connection is closed when you're done
    client.close();
    console.log("Connection closed.");
  }
}

runExample();
```

## âš¡ API Reference

The `MemoryToolsClient` class provides the following asynchronous methods to interact with your database:

### `constructor(host: string, port: number, username: string | null = null, password: string | null = null, serverCertPath: string | null = null, rejectUnauthorized: boolean = true)`

Creates a new client instance.

- **`host`** (`string`): The IP address or hostname of the MemoryTools server.
- **`port`** (`number`): The TLS port of the MemoryTools server.
- **`username`** (`string | null`, optional, defaults to `null`): The username for authenticating with the server.
- **`password`** (`string | null`, optional, defaults to `null`): The password for authenticating with the server.
- **`serverCertPath`** (`string | null`, optional, defaults to `null`):
  - If a `string`, it should be the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that signed your server's certificate. This certificate will be used to verify the server's identity.
  - If `null`, Node.js will attempt to use the operating system's default CAs for verification.
- **`rejectUnauthorized`** (`boolean`, optional, defaults to `true`):
  - If `true`, the connection will be rejected if the server's certificate cannot be verified by the provided CA or by the system's CAs.
  - If `false`, the connection will be established even if the server's certificate is invalid or cannot be verified. **Use with extreme caution in production environments.**

### `connect(): Promise<tls.TLSSocket>`

Establishes a TLS connection to the MemoryTools server and, if `username` and `password` are provided in the constructor, will attempt to authenticate the session automatically. This method will return the `tls.TLSSocket` instance once connection and authentication are successful.

**Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves with the `tls.TLSSocket` object if connection and authentication are successful. **Throws**: An `Error` if connection or authentication fails.

```javascript
try {
  const socket = await client.connect();
  console.log("TLS connection established and authenticated.");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Could not connect or authenticate:", error.message);
}
```

### `set<T = any>(key: string, value: T, ttlSeconds?: number): Promise<string>`

Stores a value in the main key-value store. The `value` will be automatically JSON-serialized.

- **`key`** (`string`): The key to store the value under.
- **`value`** (`T`): The value to store. It will be converted to a JSON string.
- **`ttlSeconds`** (`number`, optional, defaults to `0`): Time-to-live in seconds. `0` means no expiration.

**Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves with a success message string from the server. **Throws**: An `Error` if the operation fails (including not being authenticated).

```javascript
await client.set(
  "myNodeKey",
  { message: "Hello from Node.js!", timestamp: Date.now() },
  300
);
console.log("Value set successfully.");
```

### `get<T = any>(key: string): Promise<{ found: boolean, message: string, value: T | null }>`

Retrieves a value from the main key-value store. The retrieved value will be automatically JSON-parsed.

- **`key`** (`string`): The key of the value to retrieve.

**Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to an object:

- **`found`** (`boolean`): `true` if the key was found, `false` otherwise.
- **`message`** (`string`): A status message from the server.
- **`value`** (`T | null`): The retrieved value, parsed from JSON, or `null` if not found. **Throws**: An `Error` if the operation fails (e.g., invalid JSON format for stored value, or not being authenticated, but not if the key is just not found).

```javascript
const result = await client.get("myNodeKey");
if (result.found) {
  console.log("Retrieved value:", result.value);
} else {
  console.log("Key not found:", result.message);
}
```

  orderBy?: OrderByClause[]; // ORDER BY clause
  limit?: number; // LIMIT clause
  offset?: number; // OFFSET clause
  count?: boolean; // COUNT(*) equivalent
  aggregations?: { [key: string]: Aggregation }; // SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
  groupBy?: string[]; // GROUP BY clause
  having?: { [key: string]: any }; // HAVING clause (filters aggregated results)
  distinct?: string; // DISTINCT field
}

interface OrderByClause {
  field: string;
  direction: "asc" | "desc"; // "asc" or "desc"
}

interface Aggregation {
  func: "sum" | "avg" | "min" | "max" | "count";
  field: string; // Field to aggregate on, "*" for count
}
```

**Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves with the query results as a generic type `T`. **Throws**: An `Error` if the operation fails or query JSON is invalid.

```javascript
// Example query for items in 'my_collection' where age > 25, ordered by name ascending, limit 2
const queryResult = await client.collectionQuery("my_collection", {
  filter: { field: "age", op: ">", value: 25 },
  orderBy: [{ field: "name", direction: "asc" }],
  limit: 2,
});
console.log("Query results:", queryResult);
```

### `isSessionAuthenticated(): boolean`

Returns `true` if the current client session is authenticated, `false` otherwise.

Returns the username of the currently authenticated user, or `null` if not authenticated.

**Returns**: `string | null`

```javascript
const username = client.getAuthenticatedUsername();
if (username) {
  console.log(`Authenticated user: ${username}`);
} else {
  console.log("No user authenticated.");
}
```

### `close(): void`

Closes the underlying socket connection. This also resets the session's authentication state.

```javascript
client.close();
console.log("Client connection closed.");
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- **TLS is Essential**: Always use TLS for connections to your MemoryTools server, especially in production environments, to ensure data encryption in transit.
- **Certificate Verification**: For production, it's **highly recommended** to set `rejectUnauthorized` to `true` (which is the default) and provide a `serverCertPath` to the CA certificate that signed your server's certificate. This verifies that you are connecting to the legitimate server and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **`rejectUnauthorized: false`**: Only use `rejectUnauthorized: false` for development or testing purposes, where the security implications are understood and acceptable (e.g., self-signed certificates in a controlled, isolated environment). Never use this in production.
- **Authentication Credentials**: Always pass user credentials (`username` and `password`) to the `MemoryToolsClient` constructor to ensure your operations are authorized. Without credentials, you may only be able to perform anonymous operations, which the server will likely restrict.
- **Credential Management**: Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code. Instead, use environment variables, a secret management service, or a secure configuration file to manage your database credentials.
